falsepositives:
 - Storage Buckets being enumerated may be performed by a system administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. 
 - Storage Buckets enumerated from unfamiliar users should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
