title: CobaltStrike Service Installations in Registry
id: 61a7697c-cb79-42a8-a2ff-5f0cdfae0130
description: Detects known malicious service installs that appear in cases in which a Cobalt Strike beacon elevates privileges or lateral movement. 
    We can also catch this by system log 7045 (https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/win_cobaltstrike_service_installs.yml)
    In some SIEM you can catch those events also in HKLM\System\ControlSet001\Services or HKLM\System\ControlSet002\Services, however, this rule is based on a regular sysmon's events.
