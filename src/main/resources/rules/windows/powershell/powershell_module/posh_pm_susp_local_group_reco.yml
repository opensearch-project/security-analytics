title: Suspicious Get Local Groups Information
id: cef24b90-dddc-4ae1-a09a-8764872f69fc
description: |
    Adversaries may attempt to find local system groups and permission settings.
    The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.
    Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as the users found within the local administrators group.
