description: |
  Adversaries may attempt to find domain-level groups and permission settings.
  The knowledge of domain-level permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.
  Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as domain administrators.
