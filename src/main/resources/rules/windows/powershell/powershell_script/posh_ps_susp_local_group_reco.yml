title: Suspicious Get Local Groups Information
id: fa6a5a45-3ee2-4529-aa14-ee5edc9e29cb
status: experimental
description: |
    Adversaries may attempt to find local system groups and permission settings.
    The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.
    Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as the users found within the local administrators group.
