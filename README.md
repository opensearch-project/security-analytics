# OpenSearch Security Analytics

The OpenSearch Security Analytics aims to enable you to run security operations by automating threat detection and threat analysis on your data. Security analytics plugin will include a threat detection engine that will be pre-loaded with a set of detection rules, that you can customize and extend to alert on standard or custom attack patterns.

## Highlights

* This open-source framework for analyzing the security events will address the cost and complexity associated with running the security operations on your business and infrastructure data.
* It will enable you to monitor your data, generate findings and send alert notifications automatically to your stakeholders.
* The security analytics dashboards will let you manage your threats, correlate events and take remediation actions.
